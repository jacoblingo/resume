# Jacob Lingo's Resume

This is my repository housing my personal resume!

I am a experienced full-stack backend software engineer with a strong track record of independently addressing complex business
requirements and overcoming challenges to deliver complete and robust solutions.



## How to run
Install the dependencies:

```
yarn install
```

Start the development server after building the stylesheet out of the Tailwind configuration:

```
yarn build && yarn serve
```

Only generate CSS that is used on the page which results in a much smaller file size:

```
yarn build
```


## Starting Point

`docs/index.html` is the main content file. By copying HTML: add pages, sections, subsection, and other parts.


## Tailwind CSS

>Rapidly build modern websites without ever leaving your HTML.

(https://tailwindcss.com)


Code from `tailwind.config.js` and `tailwind.css` transpiles to `docs/style.css`.
