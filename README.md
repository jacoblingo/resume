## How to run
Install the dependencies:

```
yarn install
```

Start the development server after building the stylesheet out of the Tailwind configuration:

```
yarn build && yarn serve
```

Only generate CSS that is used on the page which results in a much smaller file size:

```
yarn build
```

## Starting Point

`docs/index.html` is the main content file. By copying HTML: add pages, sections, subsection, and other parts.

`npm run build` enables drag and drop support of the `docs` directory, which you find helpful unloading your copy on GitHub if terminal/command prompt is not your thing.

## Tailwind CSS

>Rapidly build modern websites without ever leaving your HTML.

## Custom CSS

Code from `tailwind.config.js` and `tailwind.css` transpiles to `docs/style.css`.

## Balanced Columns

Removing `col-fill-auto` class will make both columns equally tall. Moreover, removing `md:h-letter` and `md:h-letter-col` classes will eliminate fixed proportions of the letter or A4 page â€” thereby removing unnecessary vertical space when displaying short columns.
